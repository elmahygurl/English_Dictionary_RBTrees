# Red-Black Tree Implementation in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.

## Overview

- **Description:**
  - Implemented a Red-Black Tree using object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
  - Includes functionalities such as insertion, search, and calculation of tree height.
- **Key Features:**
  - Self-balancing properties for efficient search and insertion operations.
  - Tree height calculation for performance analysis.
- **Usage:**
  - The main script (`main.py`) demonstrates the functionality with a simple command-line interface.
    - Load dictionary from a file.
    - Insert new words into the Red-Black Tree.
    - Search for existing words.
